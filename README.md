# WordPress glossary
The initial 60 WordPress glossary terms were written by Anders Nor√©n and are used with his permission. Over the years I've collected hundreds more from all over the web and used them on my blog https://wpxss.com
This repository contains the data file (export file) for the glossary taxonomy on my blog. Feel free to use it any way you want.
